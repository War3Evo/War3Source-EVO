## Install

The easiest way to install is to use the provided installation scripts.

The scripts was created using Debian 11. If you use a different Linux OS, your mileage may vary.

You will need to be a SUDO user to fully install using this script because it requires installing special libraries for the game server.

It will prompt you for the installation directory and other information as it needs.

THIS IS A FULL INSTALL OF STEAM SERVER, SOURCEMOD, METAMOD, and War3Source-EVO!

CSS ./installcss.sh
CSGO ./installcsgo.sh
TF2 ./installtf2.sh
FOF ./installfof.sh

## Players having trouble downloading files from your CSGO server?

Make sure every player puts this into their console to enable downloads:

* sv_allowupload 1

This will allow the server to upload to the client. By default the clients have this disabled.
