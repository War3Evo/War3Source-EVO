**GAME MODE CURRENTLY SETUP TO COMPILE FOR IS TF2**

Working: TF2, ~~CSGO is only partially working, if you've got programming skills, you can make it work!~~

War3Source:Evo does require at least 1 gb of ram to run smoothly.  At minimum 750 mb of ram with 250 mb of vswap in openvz.

Updated for Sourcemod 1.8

If something is missing during compiling, let me know.


IS NOT commpatible with the Original War3Source Races. May add compatibility later, but don't get your hopes up.

Translations do not fully work on this version, as I ripped out a lot of translations during updates for my private version.  English is the language used without translation files.


# Notes

* Compiles fine for TF2, but you may need certain extensions to run
* You need to go to change the contents in the file War3Source-EVO/addons/sourcemod/scripting/include/GAME_SWITCHER/currentgame.inc in order to compile for your platform
